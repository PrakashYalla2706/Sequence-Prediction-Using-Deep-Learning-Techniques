# üìä Sequence Prediction Using Deep Learning Techniques

## üöÄ Overview
This project focuses on predicting sequences using advanced deep learning methods, specifically **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. The goal is to forecast the sequence of file blocks accessed by client applications in a distributed file system environment. By utilizing synthetic log data containing file and block access patterns, we preprocess the data and train an LSTM model to predict future block sequences based on the frequency of block usage.
